		"We started in 2018 with a simple goal: make helpful tech that people actually need. While many chase profits, we chose to do things differently.",
		"Beyond making good products, we care about doing the right thing, being kind to our planet, and making sure everyone can use what we build. That's our compass.",
		"From day one, we've asked ourselves: 'Does this actually help people?' This question gets us through tough calls and shapes who we are. We're playing the long game here.",
		"We think about how our work affects real people's lives. We build tech that brings people together, keeps your information safe, and treats everyone fairly. When we stick to these basics, good things happen."
